# Data Journalism 

I completed this project during my time at the [Columbia Engineering Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.cvn.columbia.edu/data/nyc/landing/?s=Google-Brand&pkw=%2Bdata%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bcolumbia&pcrid=392444639754&pmt=b&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=%5BS%5D_GRD_Data_Brand_ALL_NYC_BMM_New&utm_term=%2Bdata%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bcolumbia&utm_content=392444639754&s=google&k=%2Bdata%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bcolumbia&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2b7uBRDsARIsAEE9XpFH-2wU0-_7jtxCV_PCkGBR0prlyKtvpF2-nAWU1tO4oYci5h1QStsaAsg5EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) located in New York, NY.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives and to create charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings. The [data.csv](https://github.com/CarolineDelva/Data_Journalism_D3-Project/tree/master/assets/data) is based on [2014 ACS 1-year estimates](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) and includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state and MOE (margin of error).

The visualization includes the following:

- Include state abbreviations in the circles.

- Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

- Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes

- Enter tooltips: developers can implement these in their D3 graphics to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element. Add tooltips to your circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. 

## Methods Used
* Data Visualization 
* Statistical Analysis
* Data exploration


## Technologies
* JavaScript (D3)
* HTML, CSS


## Needs of this project

To test graph in terminal, run the following code:

```
python -m http.server
```

### Visualizations

### Conclusion

At a glance, it looks like there is a positive correlation between poverty and obesity, there is no clear correlation between age and obesity and there is a negative correlation between obesity and household income. It looks like there is a positive correlation between poverty and smokes, there is no clear correlation between age an smokes, and there is a negative correlation between smokes and household income. It also looks like there is a positive correlation between lack of healthcare and poverty, there is no clear correlation between lack of healthcare and age, and there is a negative correlation between lack of healthcare and household income.
